Iâ€™m into drawing portraits of strangers on an iPad Pro, eating popcorn and chicken wings, watching dust collect on my vinyl record collection, and playing single-player console exclusives.

When Iâ€™m not drawing or releasing open source Jekyll themes, I work as a web designer and content administrator for a leading global provider of laboratory products. On any given day Iâ€™m designing user-interfaces, building landing pages, and massaging content in and out of a CMS with the help of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

And if that wasnâ€™t enough to keep me busy â€” Iâ€™m also the father of twin girls and married to a subscription box addicted vegan.
